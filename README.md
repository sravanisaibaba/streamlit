Diabetes Prediction using SVM (Streamlit Deployment)

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a pregnant woman is diabetic or not using a Machine Learning model.
The model is trained using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

The app allows users to input medical details and get an instant diabetes prediction.

##  Objectives
- Build a classification model using SVM
- Train the model on diabetes dataset
- Evaluate model accuracy
- Deploy the model using Streamlit
- Create a simple interactive model predictions

---

##  Dataset
The dataset contains medical diagnostic measurements such as:

- Pregnancies  
- Glucose Level  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin Level  
- BMI  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age
- Outcomes

Target:
- 0 >> Non-Diabetic  
- 1 >> Diabetic
